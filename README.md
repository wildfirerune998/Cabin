Pebble Watchface Cabin
Ever want a look out of a cabin in the woods? Ever want to enjoy the vistas of the forest without leaving your chair? Now you can! Introducing Cabin!
Every 30min this watchface will query your location and determine the weather (requires OpenWeather key). Then it will update the background to reflect the conditions. There is also an option to turn off the weather feature if you'd prefer to enjoy a nice static woods scene.
Next to the clock, the temperature displays, with the option of Celsius and Imperial.
Stay tuned for more condition options and Pebble Time Round in the upcoming upgrade to this version.

Hope you have fun with this watchface! I had fun making it :)
